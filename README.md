# Rubik's-Cube-Solver

A 3x3 virtual Rubik’s Cube solver implementing advanced algorithms including BFS, DFS, IDDFS, and Korf’s IDA.

Built three distinct cube models using standard data structures and object-oriented design.

Solves 8-move scrambles in under 3 seconds using BFS, DFS, and IDDFS.

Achieves solution of 13-move scrambles in under 10 seconds with Korf’s IDA algorithm.

Technologies: OOP, BFS, DFS, IDDFS, IDA*.
